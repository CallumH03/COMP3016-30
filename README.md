Maze Expand is a C++ Console Game developed in Visual Studio 2022 (v143) using Windows 10 Pro 22H2. 

## Instructions
- Type **"Play"** to start and **"Q"** to quit
- Press **W/A/S/D** to move either **Up/Left/Right/Down**
- Collect the **Key** to be able to open the **Door**
- There are **10 Levels** to complete with each level getting gradually harder
- **Have Fun!**

## How my game works
The game works by waiting for the user to start the game and then fetching Maze1.txt, it then loads the maze and finds the Player (P), Key (K) and Door (D). It then asks the user to use W/A/S/D to move around the map and also allows them to quit at any time, the user needs to find the key by navigating through the maze and picking up the key. They then need to find the way to the door to open the door and move onto the next level. It then adds 1 to the current level and finds Maze2.txt and loads it, this repeats all the way to 10. Once they complete level 10 then they will be told they have completed the game and they can use Q to quit.
